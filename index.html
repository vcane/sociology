      <p> This case study is designed to examine how the concept of Kansas / Shawnee County / United States
        birth rates is developed, realized, and research within women in their own environment. The
        notion of how birth rates are declining in Kansas / Shawnee County / United States evolves within a formally
        structured professional development environment for the women who are participating in this
        study.
        </p>
      <p>
        We are looking for women ages 20 to 35 who have suffered from a miscarriage, had an abortion, are waiting to
        have a baby due to finances, or those with careers.

        Many individuals with these reasons may develop some discomfort while talking about their reasons, which can lead to a feeling of guilt or shame. This research does not seek to hurt, harm, and make an individual feel unsafe or unwelcome; but simply to research the declining birth rates in Topeka, Kansas and the United States. We are providing the consent form which will be read to you at the interview. You will be required to sign the consent form prior to us proceeding with the interview. The consent form may be downloaded <a href="IRBconsentform.pdf" download>here</a>. However, no individuals are required to download the consent form prior to meeting with the researcher. All those who wish to participate in this study, may <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us.
